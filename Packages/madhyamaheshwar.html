            <!-- <h4 class="mb-3 mt-3">The Essence of Kedarnath</h4> -->
            <h6 class=" mb-3">Sitting pretty on the foothills of towering peaks in the state's Garhwal region,
                Madhyamaheshwar (also known as Madhmaheshwar) is a revered religious site. One of the Panch Kedars (holy
                temples dedicated to Lord Shiva), Madhyamaheshwar is located in the district of Rudraprayag and is
                steeped in mythology and folklore. According to legend, after the epic Mahabharat war, the Pandavas
                wanted to pay reverence to Lord Shiva in order to absolve them from their sin. On sighting the
                approaching Pandavas, Lord Shiva turned into a bull in order to illude them. But Bhima, one of the five
                Pandava brothers, recognised the Lord and pursued him relentlessly. Lord Shiva divided his body into
                five parts to escape Bhima. The sites where the five parts of the Lord appeared are revered as the Panch
                Kedar. The middle-torso of the Lord is said to have appeared in Madhyamaheshwar ('madhya' in Hindi means
                middle). To reach the temple, visitors and pilgrims embark on a tedious 24-km-long trek. This arduous
                hike, however, is worth the effort as visitors are treated to uninterrupted views of green land and
                surrounding mountains. The temple stands opposite the Chaukhamba, Neelkanth and Kedarnath mountain
                peaks. </h6>

                <p>The trail runs through this verdant Bantoli village and, afterward, a continuous ascent takes to upper-Bantoli. Now an arduous trek takes to the final destination of the Madmaheshwar Valley, where the famous holy shrine is on the left.  </p>

                <p>The fifth day of the Madmaheshwar trek package starts with breakfast and takes you back to the Ukhimath village. The trail is well-paved and easy to trek and is the same that was followed during the ascent. It takes almost three hours to reach back to the beautiful and quaint Ukhimath, which is a popular holy shrine.  After resting for a while and refueling yourself with lunch and tea, you can go for some sightseeing.</p>
                <p>Our vehicle picks you from your hotel or tent and takes you to Rishikesh, the starting point of this Madmaheshwar trek package. Get dropped at the railway station or bus depot or the place of your choice and board your booked train or bus to your home destination. </p>
            </ul>
