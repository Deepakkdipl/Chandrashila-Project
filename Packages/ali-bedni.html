                <!-- <p class="mb-3 mt-3">The Essence of Kedarnath</p> -->
                <h6 class=" mb-3">Out of the other meadow treks in our country — Dayara Bugyal, Gidara Bugyal, and
                    Bhrigu Lake trek — Ali Bedni Bugyal has the grandest of mountain views. That’s because of one thing
                    — the sight of Mt. Trishul and Mt. Nanda Ghunti jutting right out of the meadows. Jutting out
                    doesn’t mean you see the tops of these mountains, you see the entire face — almost 6000-7000 feet of
                    it — rising right in front of you.</h6>
                <P>During Spring, the mountain views are at their sharpest and clearest, as the air is still crisp and
                    clean from the winter months. The blue sky seems to stretch on forever. The landscape is unmarred by
                    the haze and smog that can often plague the plains. The snow-capped peaks glisten in the sunlight.
                    Soon, green meadows will start peeping out from under the snow.</P>
                <P>By summer, you see meadows carpeted with fresh grass.</P>
                <p>The surprise of finding yourself in Ali Bugyal after trekking through dense forests is unbeatable.
                    The moment you get out of the shades of the forest cover, you see acres and acres of green carpet
                    sprawled out in front of you. Mt Trishul, stands tall against the blue skies, making for a
                    formidable backdrop. Horses and their foals tear themselves across the turf in an uninhibited
                    abandon while the cattle graze lazily on this bounty.</p>
                <p>The walk to Bedni Bugyal from here is exhilarating! It is a walk that tempts you to take off your
                    shoes and feel this carpet for yourselves. The Bedni Bugyal is another stop in this meadow country –
                    a strip of vibrant green, overlooking the western valley. Popping right out of this meadow-like
                    sentient, silent guards are the mountains of Trishul and Nanda Ghunti. If you climb the Bedni Top,
                    other high risers of the imposing Chaukhamba range open up before you. These incredible settings
                    make these twin meadows a must-do on the trekker’s bucket list.</p>

                <p>Day 1 of our journey starts from reaching Dehradun early in the morning at the said location. We will be departing at 6:00 AM so make sure to reach the place at least half an hour before. Lohajung falls at a distance of approximately 300 kilometres and will be reaching by the evening only at around 4/5:00 pm taking around 9-10 hours of total time. We will be halting at 2-3 roadway restaurants for some refreshments. En route, we will also be engaging ourselves in small sightseeing at places like Rishikesh & Devprayag. Once we reach Lohajung, we will be assigned to our rooms in hotels for the night. Dinner would be provided from our side.</p>
                <p>‘Make sure to withdraw any cash from Dewal which is a market area at a distance of 24 km from Lohajung. The best option is to withdraw the cash from Dehradun itself as it’s all-time available. Online Transactions are also at times available in Lohajung for those using GooglePay or PhonePe but it too depends upon luck!
                    Lohajung also happens to be the base camp of other treks like the Brahmatal Trek, Roopkund Trek. At a height of 7,600km, this is going to be the last place you will be receiving electricity as well as network (no Jio available). Be sure to make every possible calls because after this you are going to be unavailable from the rest of the world for 4 Days.</p>

Enjoy the quiet night at the campsite amidst the dense forest with an excitement-filled for the next day trekking to Ali Bugyal.</p>
                    <p>We will start our trekking in the morning at 9:00 after the completion of our breakfast and some sightseeing. Enjoy your time with the over loving locals and their warm hospitality.</p>

                    <p>The third day initially calls for our main trek to Ali Bugyal which is at a height of 3400 meters. This town can be spotted from the Didina village itself and is full of greenery and wide grasslands giving a full panoramic view of the Meadows. Considered to be one of the biggest Meadows of India, this place remains less crowded due to its curvy tricky trail but definitely takes your full attention when you reach at your destination. During winters, you cannot resist the snow-covered Meadows enchanting you to the depth of your heart. The snowy path with dense dark forests becomes a way beautiful trek among all other trekking trails. Not to forget are the beautiful photographs you should capture before moving further as a memory to this awesome trek. Though considered to be an easy trail yet is going to be challenging for its steep ascending rocky trail.

                    <p>Bedni Bugyal connects the trails towards Roopkund which is almost near to the Wan Village. Mt. Trishul and Nanda Ghunti can be seen clearly standing tall against your face around the whole wide alpine Meadow you gonna reach to. This lush green alpine Highland adorns itself with varieties of floras amazing you at every step you take. Bedni Bugyal is quite famous and imprinted in the minds of enthusiasts. Not to forget, is a beautiful small lake named ‘Bedni Kund’ also locally called Vaitarani situated amidst the Meadow. The highlights of the flora community are the ‘Brahm Kamal’ which takes our attention at such a height. This meadow has the ability to overpower any other trekking locations especially a Meadow trek spot. Boasting about its humongous acres of land along with the Grandeur of the mountains, this place will run down a chill to your spine once you reach the spot. Being the highest Bugyal of Uttarakhand, trekkers are definitely going to face Heaven on Earth. It is also a major stopover for tourists and devotees during the ‘Nanda Devi Raj Jaat Yatra’ – A very Famous ritual procession taking place once in an every 12 years. People used to trek Roopkund as they used to come to visit this Yatra before.</p>
                    <p>After spending much time having to enjoy and feel every bit of its calm nature, we come down for our night stay at our campsite in Geruli Paatal which is around 3-4 kilometres from Bedni Bugyal. A total trek of 6 km will be done on this day. Again the camping is done amidst dense oak forest enjoying a nice bonfire with all the people enjoying to their fullest.</p>

                <p>(Day 5, today we will be moving back to Lohajung but by a different route which is from Geruli Paatal to Neelganga and then to the very famous Wan Village And finally to Lohajung by car.)</p>

                    <p>Today we return back to Lohajung but before that, we have a surprise for our trekkers. A whole new beautiful trail from Geruli Paatal to Neelganga and then to the obscured Wan Village from where we return to Lohajung by Car. The trail can be as heavenly as one can imagine it to be. Through the ridges of the alpine Meadow, this trails calls for some mind-blowing scenery along the trek. Big outcrops with huge grassy outlands are what this trail is going to surprise you with.</p>
                    <p>Wan village is an obscured but a favourite resting spot for all the trekkers going or returning from Roopkund or Homkund treks. This small unknown yet the magical village has its own charm due to its untouched greenery and less or no visitors. With very few people nestling in this village, the trekkers can take a nice short rest and fill up their water bottles if needed. Though many people also choose to stay in the provided accommodations by the villagers to feel the whole quiet and serene vibe of the place. The lush greenery is what attracts these people the most.</p>
                    <p>Also, one more reason to stay in this village is the famous ‘Laatu Devta Temple’ which is known to be very powerful and religious by the locals. It is said to have absolutely no visitors just anytime. The door of the temple is usually closed and opens at the time of April mostly. Locals usually came up with many ancient stories, one of which is that at this time King Cobra is said to arrive in the temple with its Pearl Stone and the Priest of the temple blindfolds himself while praying and only he is allowed to enter the doors of the temple. The other people are allowed to pray from about 75 metres away from the shrine. But it is yet unknown to the people if there’s actually something such that arrives inside the s babyhrine. This place is mythologically and religiously followed by the locals.</p>
                    <p>Return to Lohajung is done by car the same day which will be from our side only. Reaching this place by late Afternoon asks for a long rest with a good heavy meal and adding in the last few memories of the place in our travel book. Make sure to grasp every single bit of fun and enjoyment.</p>

                    <p> we return back to our main destination point Dehradun by Bus after our breakfast. We will be definitely missing every bit of the trails we’ve covered in the last 6 days, the fun, the tiredness, the scenes, the laughter, everything that added colour to this beautiful trek. The locals and their children will be overwhelmingly expecting you to visit them again.
                        As for us, we will definitely as usual always bid a sad Sayonara and expect a hopeful Howdy for the next adventurous trek trip.</p>
